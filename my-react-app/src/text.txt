browse/vdom
life cycle--> of components tells us how element behaving from component creation to removal from dom.
        1.mounting state
                1.1*componetdidmount(){},---it is a method where we can perfrom the side effects
                side effects are:
                        1.http calls when page load
                        2.dom manipulation when page load
                        3.timer trigger when page load
                        4.event listenrs when page load
                1.2*getderivedsartesfromprops(){},---it changes the sates based on the props over the time.
                1.3*render(){},----to insert the jsx inside the dom,we acttually need these method
                1.4constructor(){}--- it is used to create and intialize the state in class 
                excute seq-constructor,getderivedsartesfromprops,render,componetdidmount
        2.updateting state---
        2.1contructor*
        2.2render*
        2.3componetdidupdate(){}--when ever a comp is udated,then method will be excute.
        2.4*shouldcomponetdidupdate(){}--it will decide the component is update or not.This will give the boolean values.
        2.5getsnapshotbeforeupdate(){}--it will containe the information of sates before updating.
        excute seq-
        3.unmounting state


virtual dom--->    it's a in memory-representation of original dom
                -->when ever component render ,then virtual dom will create/froms.
                -->*** whenever any new updates occurs,then new virtual dom will forms,and after comparing it with old virtual dom.(diffing)
                -->it identify the exact changes b/w the doms(old&new virtual dom).
                -->***react will analysis require changes to be done to the real dom and update.thies process can be called as a reconcilation.
Pure component-->
              -->whenever a component avoids unnecessary re-rendering and render only if it's state updates,then it can be called as a pure component.
              -->unnecessary means,ther is no any change in sate then it should not render.
              functional componet use--reat.memo()--it use the pure component
              class component--we will import purecomponent instead of componet.
Stateless and statefu component-->
        a Stateless component is a component thet doesn't have it's own state and simply renders with it's propscoming fromthe parent component.
------>a functional component can be called as a Stateless component,why because it doesn't have own state and own lifecycle method
